// Benjamin Bulbs

// Question ----> You are given n number of bulbs. They are all switched off A wire fluctuation in voltage hits

// ----> the circuit n times in 1st fluctuation all bulb toggled in the 2nd fluctuation every 2nd

// ----> bukb is toggled in 3rd fluctuation every 3rd is togged and so on. You have to find which bukb is turned on
 // after all fluctuation
 
 // print all the bulbs which remain ON
 
 Example
 Input 20
 output 1, 4, 9, 16
 
logic is all perfect square number/bulbs remain ON
